## Profile
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zachnad0
- 👀 I’m interested in the areas of artificial intelligence (specifically neural networks and machine learning), programming embedded systems, and developing methods of combining both.
- 🌱 I’m currently dealing with C++ (the standard lib naming conventions are still terrible).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the acquisition of US$ (via automated trading software?)
- 📫 How to reach me is to send *free money* via the mail...

Am just another *amatuer* and student backend .NET and embedded systems developer.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zachnad0
- 👀 I’m interested in the areas of artificial intelligence (specifically neural networks and machine learning), programming embedded systems, and potentially combining both.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ (why must it be so painful).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the acquisition of US$.
- 📫 How to reach me is to send <i>free money</i> via the mail.

I'm an amateur game crafter, currently working on somethin' that I'm not going to reveal *just* yet.
C# is actually usable for NN and ML.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zachnad0
- 👀 I’m interested in c# for development of programs, including games, and scripts for Space Engineers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Unity development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I don't have a small private team working on, in which they essentially never do anything anyways.
- 📫 How to reach me is to send free money via the mail.

Uh yea so I'm makin' some games in Godot using GDScript and crap so uh yea.
C# is the best language, and one cannot prove otherwise, unless you do.
